## JPO Conflict Monitor Release Notes

## Version 1.1.0

### **Summary**

The second release for the jpo-conflictmonitor, version 1.1.0. The conflict monitor provides functionallity for performing near realtime analysis of SPaT, Map and BSM messages generated by the ODE. This analysis is used to generate Events, Assessments and Notifications about performance of intersections feeding into the Conflict Monitor.  Read more about the jpo-conflictvisualizer in the [main README](../README.md).

Enhancements in this release:

- Updates to Stop Line Stop Event and Stop Line Passage Event logic to better detect vehicle ingress and egress pairs
- Improved CIMMS data partitioning to properly scale with available brokers and intersections
- Improved System Assessments to aggregate multiple events for a given intersection
- Notifications have been adjusted to only trigger once for each failing case in an assessment
- Updated BSM parititoning to spatially link intersections with BSM's
- updated BSM path building to properly truncate vehicle events when a Vehicle leaves the intersection
- Added ability to store algorithm configuration in mongoDB
- Updated Assessment Aggregators to pair Assessments with the events that generated them
- Corrected Time Change Details Event logic not matching logic outlined in CIMMS system requirements document

Enhancements in this release:

- Ability to detect OBU's passing through an intersection and create events
- Ability to create the following events: SpatBroadcastRate, MapBroadcastRate, SpatMinimumdata, MapMinimumData, ConnectionOfTravel, IntersectionReferenceAlignmentEvents, LaneDirectionOfTravelEvents, SignalGroupAlignmentEvents, SignalStateConflictEvents, SigtnalStateStopEvents, TimeChangeDetailsEvents
- Ability to create the following assessments: ConnectionOfTravelAssessment, LaneDirectionOfTravelAssessments, SignalStateAssessmentGroup, SignalStateEventAssessments
- Ability to create the following Notifications: ConnectionOfTravelNotification, IntersectionReferenceAlignmentNotification, LaneDirectionOfTravelNotification, SignalGroupAlignmentNotification, SignalStateConflictNotification, TimeChangeDetailsNotification
- Topic configuration system build upon mongoDB for configuration state store
- Initial Commit: Adding Codebase for ingesting data, generating events, assessments and notifications.
